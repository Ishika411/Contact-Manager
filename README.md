# Contact Manager

Demo -> https://github.com/Ishika411/Contact-Manager

The provided code implements a Contact Management System in C++. It enables users to manage contact information efficiently with options to add and search for contacts. The system stores contacts, including first name, last name, and a 10-digit phone number, in a text file (number.txt) for persistence. The program features a main menu with four options: adding a new contact, searching for an existing contact, displaying a help menu, and exiting the application. When adding contacts, the system ensures data integrity by validating the phone number for length and numeric content. Users can search for contacts using either the first or last name, with results displayed if a match is found. Designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind, this project is a practical example of file handling and basic validation in C++, suitable for personal use or as a learning tool for beginners in programming.
